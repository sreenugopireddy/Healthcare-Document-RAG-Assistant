# 🏥 Healthcare Document RAG Assistant  
### A Modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Medical Knowledge QA

The Healthcare Document RAG Assistant is a domain-specific question answering system built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It allows users to query healthcare documents and receive context-grounded answers generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).

Instead of relying only on model memory, the system retrieves semantically relevant passages from indexed medical PDFs and conditions the LLM response strictly on that retrieved context. This reduces hallucinations and improves answer traceability, which is critical in healthcare scenarios.

The project demonstrates a full end-to-end RAG workflow including document ingestion, chunking, embedding generation, FAISS vector indexing, semantic retrieval, guarded prompt construction, and source-attributed answer generation through an interactive interface.

# 🏗️ System Architecture

The system uses a two-stage RAG architecture separating offline indexing from online query answering.

## Offline Indexing Pipeline

```
Healthcare PDFs
 → Document Loader
 → Text Cleaning
 → Chunking + Overlap
 → Embedding Generation
 → FAISS Vector Index
```

## Online Query Pipeline

```
User Query
 → Query Preprocessing
 → Query Embedding
 → Top-K Vector Retrieval
 → Context Assembly
 → Guarded Prompt Builder
 → LLM Generation
 → Answer + Source Citations
```

This separation allows knowledge base updates without modifying runtime generation logic.

# 📥 Document Ingestion

- PDFs are parsed into text
- Noise and formatting artifacts reduced
- Text split into semantic chunks
- Overlap preserves context continuity
- Each chunk embedded into vector space
- Stored in FAISS index with metadata

## Chunking Strategy

- Chunk size tuned for semantic completeness  
- Overlap prevents boundary information loss  
- Source metadata retained for citation  

---

# 🔎 Retrieval Strategy

Semantic similarity search is used for retrieval.

- Query embedded using same embedding model
- FAISS nearest-neighbor search
- Top-K chunks selected
- Similarity score filtering applied
- Retrieved passages shown as sources

Planned upgrades:

- Hybrid keyword + vector retrieval  
- Re-ranking layer  
- Metadata filtering  

---

# 🧠 Prompt Engineering & Guardrails

Guarded prompts enforce safe generation behavior:

- Answer only from retrieved context
- Refuse when evidence missing
- No speculative medical advice
- Structured answer format
- Source-grounded responses

Example rule:

```
Answer only using provided medical context.
If not found, respond: Not available in documents.
```

---

# 🛡️ Safety Controls

Because this is a healthcare domain system:

- Context-grounded generation only  
- Refusal behavior for unsupported queries  
- Medical disclaimer shown  
- No diagnosis or prescription claims  
- Source traceability enforced  

---

# 📊 Retrieval Evaluation

Evaluation focused on retrieval relevance and grounding.

## Evaluation Checks

- Top-K relevance inspection  
- Context-answer alignment  
- Paraphrase query stability  
- Similarity score validation  
- Manual grounding verification  

## Observations

- Semantic retrieval stable across paraphrases  
- Chunk overlap improves completeness  
- Guarded prompts reduce hallucination  
- Refusal behavior works correctly  

## Planned Metrics

- Precision@K  
- Recall@K  
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)  
- Automated benchmark queries
